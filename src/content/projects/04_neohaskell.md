## Overview

**NeoHaskell** is a dialect of Haskell that reimagines functional programming for the modern era, specifically designed to build AI-ready systems from the ground up. The language removes accidental complexity while preserving the syntactical elegance of Haskell, making it accessible to developers regardless of their programming background. It represents a fundamental rethinking of how programming languages should evolve to support both human developers and AI-powered development tools.

## Features

- ðŸ”§ **Integrated Build System**: Single CLI tool (`neo`) for all development needs
- ðŸ“š **Beautiful Standard Library**: Intuitive APIs that make the right thing the easy thing
- âš¡ **Flow State Programming**: Type system so powerful yet invisible that coding feels dynamic
- ðŸ”„ **Event Sourcing & CQRS Ready**: Built-in architectural patterns for scalable, maintainable systems
- ðŸŽ¯ **Fearless Concurrency**: Race conditions and deadlocks become compile-time errors
- ðŸš€ **Lazy Evaluation**: Compute only what's needed, when it's needed
- ðŸ§  **AI-First Design**: Native Python interoperability for seamless integration with AI/ML ecosystems
- ðŸ“± **Mobile Development**: Native mobile app support with auto-update capabilities

## Tech Stack

- **Core Language**: Haskell-based with GHC plugin architecture for dialect implementation
- **Type System**: Advanced type inference eliminating most type annotations
- **Concurrency Model**: Built-in async/await with channels for communication
- **Interoperability**: Direct Python code embedding via quasi-quoters
- **Build Tool**: Custom `neo` CLI for project management and multi-platform deployment
- **String/List Types**: Modern defaults (Text instead of String, efficient collections)
- **Architecture Support**: Pre-thought patterns for CLI, backend, and UI applications

## My Contribution

Conceived and developed NeoHaskell as a solo project to push the boundaries of AI-ready systems development. The language design addresses fundamental issues in modern software development: high team rotation, context switching overhead, and the need for systems that both humans and AI can understand and modify effectively. Every design decision prioritizes reducing cognitive load while maintaining the mathematical rigor that makes functional programming powerful.

## Impact

- **Paradigm Shift in Language Design**: Demonstrates how languages can be designed with AI collaboration as a first-class concern
- **Accessibility Revolution**: Makes functional programming accessible to developers who found Haskell intimidating
- **Productivity Multiplier**: Enables developers to maintain complex systems with minimal context retention
- **AI Integration Pioneer**: First functional language to seamlessly integrate Python's AI ecosystem
- **Community Building**: Growing community focused on developer happiness over academic purity
- **Future-Proofing Development**: Creates codebases that are inherently more maintainable by both humans and AI systems

## Vision & Philosophy

NeoHaskell challenges the traditional approach to programming language development by treating the language as a product rather than a specification. It recognizes that in high-rotation teams and AI-assisted development, the ability to quickly understand and modify code matters more than theoretical purity. The project establishes a "parallel universe" in the Haskell ecosystem, leveraging existing tooling while introducing patterns that would be considered heretical in traditional Haskell.

The language is specifically designed for developers who have "too many things in their head" and want to release their ideas without maintaining extensive mental context. It's a direct response to the increasing complexity of modern software development and the emergence of AI as a development partner, creating a foundation where both human intuition and machine understanding can thrive together.
