## Overview

**Booster Tutor** is a VSCode extension that serves as an intelligent chatbot assistant specifically designed to help developers work with the Booster Framework. Developed before the mainstream adoption of GitHub Copilot and modern AI coding assistants, it pioneered the concept of framework-specific conversational AI guidance directly within the development environment. The extension now lives within the Booster Framework open-source organization, serving the broader developer community.

## Features

- ðŸ’¬ Interactive chat interface accessible through VSCode sidebar
- ðŸŽ“ Context-aware guidance for Booster Framework concepts and patterns
- ðŸ“š Real-time suggestions for implementing CQRS and Event Sourcing patterns
- ðŸ”§ Code generation assistance for Commands, Events, Entities, and Read Models
- ðŸ“– Inline documentation and best practices recommendations
- ðŸŽ¯ Framework-specific troubleshooting and debugging assistance

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: VSCode Extension API with webview-based chat interface
- **Architecture**: Turborepo monorepo structure for extension development
- **Language**: TypeScript for both extension logic and UI components
- **Integration**: Direct integration with VSCode workspace and file system
- **Testing**: ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- **Build System**: Modern bundling with TypeScript compilation

## My Contribution

Conceived and developed the entire extension independently, including the conversational interface, Booster-specific knowledge base, and context-aware suggestion system. The extension understands developer context within Booster projects and provides relevant guidance based on file content and project structure. After development, contributed the project to the Booster Framework organization for community benefit.

## Impact

- **Pioneer in Framework-Specific AI**: One of the first VSCode extensions to provide conversational AI assistance for a specific framework, predating modern coding assistants
- **Reduced Learning Curve**: Enabled developers new to event-sourcing and CQRS patterns to understand complex Booster concepts through interactive dialogue
- **Accelerated Development**: Provided instant access to best practices and code templates without context switching, improving developer flow
- **24/7 Community Support**: Served thousands of developers as an always-available tutor, reducing dependency on documentation and community forums
- **Framework Adoption**: Lowered the barrier to entry for the Booster Framework, contributing to increased adoption rates
- **Knowledge Democratization**: Made expert-level framework knowledge accessible to developers at all skill levels

## Historical Significance

This project represents a milestone in AI-assisted development tools, demonstrating early on that conversational AI could enhance developer productivity within specialized frameworks. Built before GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT, it validated the concept of embedding domain-specific knowledge into development tools for contextual assistance.
